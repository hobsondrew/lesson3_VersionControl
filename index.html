            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems are a very handy tool for a user to have, especially for web designers. Version Control Systems record the changes that are made to a file or to a set of files over time, and keeps them saved. This comes in handy for web designers that have multiple versions of a certain image they are using or a website layout they are tinkering with, all of their ideas and versions of it will be saved along the way making it easy to recall them later. This is also very helpful in situations where you might have lost or ruined a project, there will be multiple backed up versions that you may recall upon.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is different from other version control systems in the way that it works in a couple of ways. Git thinks about its data in a different way, other version control systems think of its data as a set of files and the changes it makes to those files over time. Git is different in that it thinks of its data as snapshots of a small file system. Basically, in Git, when you save a project, Git will save a snapshot of what the file looks like at the time that you saved it, and then stores that snapshot of the project.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git runs most of its operations by only needing local files and resources. By doing everything through local files and resources, Git has an extremely speedy edge on CVCSâ€™s because they run their operations through a network making everything take longer. Git having everything local and readily available makes its operations run much smoother and quicker. However, speed is not the only advantage to running everything locally. This also means that all of your files and such are able to be modified while your machine is offline or not connected to a network of some sort. Your computer can just run everything off of its local memory instead of needing to call on a network.

                <span class="text-muted">How Git's Checksumming Works</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Everything that is saved in Git is going to be check summed and then referred to by that check sum. This makes it pretty much impossible to manipulate any of the contents of a file or directory without Git knowing what happened. The user will never lose information while its being moved around nor get file corruption without Git being able to detect it. Git uses a mechanism for checksumming called SHA-1 hash. SHA-1 hash is a 40 character string of characters (0-9 and a-f) and this checksum is calculated by the contents of the file or directory structure in Git.

                <span class="text-muted">Three States of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three states that a file will go through when it is being modified in Git. These three states are committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that the data that was being modified is being safely stored in your local database. Modified just indicates that you are still modifying the data, but you have yet to commit it yet, or store it to your local database. Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its original form to go into your next commit snapshot on Git.  </p>
